# SAP Manager Assistance [Confidential Free]

SAP Manager Assistance is a desktop automation tool for the demonstration of expired incident information in the tree-list structure. In the meantime, it helps product support managers to send emails. 

All confidential information has been removed.

Also, this is not an SAP paid product but a project that I tried to solve some redundancy issues in my working procedure. Please send me an email (qianyilun@gmail.com) if you are interested in.
