# SAP Manager Assistance [Confidential Free]

SAP Manager Assistance is a desktop automation tool for the demonstration of expired incident information in the tree-list structure. In the meantime, it helps product support managers to send emails. 

All confidential information has been removed.

SAP-Manager-Assistance is not an SAP paid product, it is a project that I solve redundancy issues in my working procedure. Please send me an email (qianyilun@gmail.com) if you are interested in.
